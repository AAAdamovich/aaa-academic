        Significant project for "Advanced Topics in Computer Science" course taken in high school. This was after I had taken AP
        Computer Science A. This "Advanced Topics" course covered the now-deprecated AP Computer Science AB course that
        our instructor used to teach. Other topics included Java and web programming.

    A homework assignment that became a work of passion in CSC 240: "Computer Programming III" at West Chester University. 
        After being told that it was not possible to skip a course that I had already taken at community college, I handed 
        in this project that had additional functionality not mentioned in the specifications. The professor for the course gave
        me an A in the class after grading this project. I did not have to take the final exam.
