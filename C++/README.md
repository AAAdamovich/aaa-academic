# academic-C
## Introduction
Repository contains C and C++ code. The C++ programs are from my time at Drexel University and C programs from classes at West Chester University (WCU)
## Spotlight: grsh.c
Please read grsh_manual.md if you would like to run the program and learn about its functionality. 
grsh stands for "Golden Ram SHell". Written for WCU "Operating Systems" class. grsh is supposed to function like a typical Unix/Linux terminal emulator, sometimes referred to as a CLI, (Command Line Interpreter) with some limitations. The shell implements three built-in commands: **path**, **cd**, and **exit**. Otherwise, grsh will search the directories stored in its path variable for directory paths to executable binaries.
